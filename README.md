# Module Library Block
Once installed in a course it will allow course administrators to copy pre-defined templates of modules (activities and assessments) to any topic of the course.

## Site Settings
In the site administration you will have to select an existing course category to be the template category. All courses related to that category will be available as Template Courses in the settings of the block.
Once a Template Category has been chosen a second settings will allow to define a default Template Course which will be used by default when the Modue Library block is first added to a course. Once installed the course administrator may change the Template Course in the block settings.

## Select a Template Course
After the initial installation of the plugin the default Template Course (see above) will be active. 
To chose a different Template Course enter the block settings where you will be presented by a list of available Template Courses. Switching between Template Courses will not affect any modules or topics installed in your course.

## Template Course
### Modules
All modules - activities and assessments - that are installed in topic/section 1 of a selected template course will be show as available modules in the Module Library block.

You may chose any number of modules before selecting a target section of the course to install them into.

### Sections
Alternatively you my choose one or more entire sections from the Module Library. Sections will be installed after the selected target section of the course.

Added modules or sections may then be treated like any other module or section.
 
## How it works
To copy one or more of the available elements first select them using the checkboxes. Then chose a section where you want the elemnts(s) to be installed.
When the installation is complete the page will reload.

Please note: A template module will be copied incuding all of its data if present.
